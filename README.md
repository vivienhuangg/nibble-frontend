## User Journey (Assignment 2)

**Trigger**
It's a Sunday afternoon, and Vivien and her roommates want to bring dessert to a potluck. They remember that their friend Saph had made _Matcha Brownies_ before and saved the recipe in their shared cookbook. Rather than searching through screenshots or old texts, they open the app.

---

**Step 1: Browsing the Cookbook**

Vivien navigates to the **Cookbook View**.. In the sidebar, she sees all her cookbooks — _Family Recipes_, _Cocktails!!!_, and _WIP…_. She clicks on _Roommate Meals_, which opens up a grid of recipe cards. Alongside their _Steak_ dinner recipe, she spots _Matcha Brownies_, tagged as _dessert, matcha, potluck_. The tags make it easy to find the right recipe for the occasion.

---

**Step 2: Opening the Recipe**
Clicking on the card brings Vivien into the **Recipe View**. The recipe title _Matcha Brownies_ is at the top, with the header showing it belongs to _Roommate Meals_. The version number reads **3.7**, authored by _Saph_ on _8/28/2025_, and the recipe is forked twice. To the right, she sees it’s currently shared with their apartment group _APT 511_.
Scrolling down, Vivien notices a previous comment she made on the ingredient _“1 tsp vanilla extract”_ — _“Vanilla Bourbon Paste is better!!!”_ (9/28/2025). There’s also a question annotation from their friend Bob on one of the steps. These embedded notes remind the group of personal tweaks and open discussions, instead of cluttered chats.

**Step 3: Exploring the Version History**

Before baking, Vivien clicks into the **Version View**. On the right-hand panel, she sees _Version 3.7 — “Gluten-Free version!”_ created earlier that day. The highlights in the ingredient and recipe sections make the changes clear compared to the previous version — a different type of flour, slight adjustments in baking time. Now Vivien can decide whether to use the gluten-free fork or stick with the standard recipe.

---

**Step 4: Cooking and Contributing**
The roommates follow the gluten-free version for the potluck. After baking, Vivien clicks “+ New Version” to record their outcome. She tags it as _potluck hit_ and notes, _“Cut sugar by 20%, still delicious.”_ This becomes Version 3.8, instantly visible in the _Roommate Meals_ cookbook for everyone in APT 511.

---

**Outcome**
Instead of repeating old mistakes or losing track of tweaks, Vivien and her roommates have a shared, evolving record of their favorite recipes. Annotations capture tips and questions, version history highlights adaptations, and cookbooks organize everything by context. What once was a messy thread of screenshots is now a collaborative cooking journal that makes group meals smoother and more fun.
