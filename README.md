## User Journey:

As a home cook who shares with friends, I open Nibble’s landing page and see my cookbooks alongside ones shared with me. I enter **Family Recipes**, open **Chicken Noodle Soup**, and use **AI Draft** to make it more complex. After a short generate state, Nibble shows yellow‑highlighted changes across ingredients and steps so I can quickly review what the AI modified. It looks good and matches what I have on hand, so I **Save**; the recipe updates and version history records the AI‑authored changes.

Later, prepping for friends, I recall a strong **Lychee Martini** my roommate shared in the **Cocktails** cookbook. Because I can’t edit her recipe directly, I **Fork** it, then run **AI Draft → Make non‑alcoholic**. The alcohol is removed, substitutes are added, and all AI edits are again highlighted for clarity. I rename it **“Non‑alcoholic Lychee Martini,”** save my new version (I own and can edit/delete it; my roommate cannot), and add a quick **comment** (“Use lychee juice to keep it NA”). Nibble’s flow—browse, AI‑assist, diff review, save/fork, and comment—supports fast ideation, clear provenance, and lightweight social feedback.
